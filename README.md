## Bug Reports

A repo for submitting bug reports in markdown form via GitHub Issues

## Why?

I really like using GitHub-flavored Markdown to compose bug reports.  I need a public way to host those bug reports for easy sharing with those who I am submitting reports to.  Here I can use the issue tracking to compose those bug reports and close them once they are addressed.
